# Second Task

In the second task we will take the stopwatch and add some new features:

- A 'lap' button that is active while the timer is active
- A scrollable list of lap times

____

The list of lap times is not required to be in a specific position or have a
specific style, but it should also display the lap number next to the lap
time.

When a user taps the lap button, the current time should be recorded and added
to the list of lap times.

The list of lap times should reset when a new timer starts.

(Optional) Write a unit test to make sure this behavior works correctly.

____

Once finished, make a git commit and continue to the third task.
